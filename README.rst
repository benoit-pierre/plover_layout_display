Custom Layouts
----------------

You can customize the display in various ways by loading your own layout file. Layout file preferences are saved and loaded automatically for each stenography system that you use them for.

See the `stenography layout JSON Schema <https://github.com/nsmarkop/plover_layout_display/blob/cb8ede4a2221e08cd44345c324a9874f8195fcb8/layout_display/resources/steno_layout.schema.json>`__ for the format to use when creating your own layout files.
